# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# MS-OUTLOOK-CLONE TSX

I got this project idea while I was staring at my email while at work and said, " Hey I bet you, I can recreate this with React ".
The idea of this project was to fulfill the requirements of CRUD ( Create Read Update Delete )
CRUD was fulfilled on 07/24/2022. Project will be ongoing. I basically put together this project as I was learning React and Typescript.
This project, has taught me alot about myself as a Developer, mainly logic,reasoning and comprehension and learning how to learn.
Also live coding is scary LOL. Thank you to all that guided me thru this project when I was stuck and @micheaaa for contributing.

Current Features:

Create => When we send email, it creates what we sent in the sent link.
          We can also save drafts as well.

Read => When we click on the email we like to view, 
        it will either be a modal or display on the 
        right side of the screen.
        
Update => When we save our drafts, we need to be 
          able to update our drafts for whatever reason.
          
Delete => We can delete items and remove from the the array stack.


Technologies Used:
CSS
React
TypeScript
React Router
Zustand State Management


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
